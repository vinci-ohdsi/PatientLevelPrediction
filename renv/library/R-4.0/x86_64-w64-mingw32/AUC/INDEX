accuracy                Compute the accuracy curve.
auc                     Compute the area under the curve of a given
                        performance measure.
churn                   Churn data
plot.AUC                Plot the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and
                        roc curves.
roc                     Compute the receiver operating characteristic
                        (ROC) curve.
sensitivity             Compute the sensitivity curve.
specificity             Compute the specificity curve.
