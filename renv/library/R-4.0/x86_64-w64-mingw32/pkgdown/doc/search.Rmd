pkgdown websites can integrate search capability using [DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/) from Algolia. DocSearch is a powerful search engine that is free for documentation websites. There are only two steps needed to enable DocSearch on a pkgdown website.

## Indexing

Once you have published your pkgdown website, submit the [pkgdown site URL to Docsearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Docsearch will contact you via e-mail to confirm you are the website owner.

Docsearch will set up a crawler configuration that indexes your site every 24 hours. pkgdown builds a suggested Docsearch crawler configuration in `docsearch.json` and you should point the Docsearch team to this configuration as a starting point. If you want to optimize your search, Docsearch will accept pull requests to the configuration that incorporate [additional options](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs#introduction) to fine tune the scraping.

## Configuration

The Docsearch team will e-mail you some JavaScript to integrate into your website.

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
  docsearch({ 
    apiKey: 'API_KEY',  // a long hex string
    indexName: 'INDEX_NAME', 
    inputSelector: '### REPLACE ME ####', 
    debug: false // Set debug to true if you want to inspect the dropdown 
}); 
```

Put the value of the `apiKey` and `indexName` parameters into your site `_pkgdown.yml` under `template: params`:

```yaml
template:
  params:
    docsearch:
      api_key: API_KEY
      index_name: INDEX_NAME
```

You also need to add a `url:` field to `_pkgdown.yml` that specifies the location of your documentation on the web. For pkgdown, the URL field is:

```yaml
url: https://pkgdown.r-lib.org
```

If you are building your own custom Docsearch index, you can also include your Docsearch `app_id` in `_pkgdown.yml`.

See the [pkgdown configuration](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/blob/master/pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml#L7-L11) for a functional search configuration.

Once this configuration is complete, you should find a search bar after re-building your site. After search is enabled, pressing `shift` + `/` (i.e., "?") will move the focus to the search bar.
