Changes in Version 0.6

    o Weighted Brier decompositions, optionally with resampling,
      are now available via brierscore().

    o Scoring family parameters can now be specified by row,
      allowing for a unique scoring rule for each forecast.

    o logscore() now receives the reverse argument so that
      scores go from -infty (worst) to 0 (best).

Changes in Version 0.5-1

    o Fixed a bug in calcscore() when ordered=TRUE, whereby
      forecasts associated with outcomes in the final category
      were scored incorrectly.

Changes in Version 0.5

    o Added support for scoring rules that are sensitive
      to distance; see Jose et al, 2009, Management Science.

    o Added Brier score convenience function that also returns
      mean scores and Brier score decompositions.  Also added
      log score and spherical score convenience functions.

    o Fixed bug in scalescores(), whereby a lower bound < 0 and
      reverse=TRUE resulted in incorrect scaling.

    o Added code testing via testthat package to ensure bugs stay
      fixed.

Changes in Version 0.4

    o Fixed bug in scalescores(), causing some min/max values of
      pow- and sph-families to be computed incorrectly.  This
      impacted attempted use of the 'bounds' argument.

    o Corrected the 'made' column of WeatherProbs to reflect correct
      dates.

Changes in Version 0.3

    o Added support for scoring forecasts with greater than 2
      alternatives.

    o Added data WeatherProbs, which contains three-category weather
      forecasts concerning temperature and precipitation.

    o Argument 'scaling' in calcscore() and plotscore() replaced with
      'bounds', so the user can supply desired lower and upper bounds
      of the scores.

    o Added a 'reverse' argument that, if TRUE, assigns larger 
      scores to good forecasters (as opposed to smaller scores).

Changes in Version 0.2

    o Fixed a bug associated with the beta family, where scaling=TRUE 
      sometimes still resulted in scores > 1.

    o Updated Merkle & Steyvers reference to reflect its acceptance.
